pyHCA and hcatk (HCA toolkit) are a python library and executable for the Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis of protein sequences.
pyHCA implements various class and function for handling sequences and analyses them
hcatk provides off the hands set of program to perform hydrophobic cluster analyses.

Requires
========
- Biopython >= 1.65
- python3   >= 3.4

Installation
============
pip3 install .

Usage
=====

annotate
--------

Use the composition in hydrophobic cluster of a sequence to detect domains.

$ hcatk annotate -h

usage: hcatk annotate [-h] -i INPUTF -o OUTPUTF [-v]
                      [-m {cluster,domain}]
                      [-t {aminoacid,nucleotide}]

Arguments:
~~~~~~~~~

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUTF             an amino-acid sequence files in fasta format
  -o OUTPUTF            the output file with annotation
  -v                    keep temporary results
  -m {cluster,domain}
                        method to use, cluster: will report *the hydrophobic
                        clusters found in the sequence, domain: will delineate
                        domains based on the hydrophobic cluster profile of
                        the sequence
  -t {aminoacid,nucleotide}
                        the type of the biological sequences passed in the
                        input file

draw
----

Draw the HCA diagram of a sequence.
Optionnaly, can display the domain annotation of a sequence if provied.

$ hcatk draw -h

usage: hcatk draw [-h] -i FASTAFILE [-d DOMAIN] [-f {pfam,seghca}] -o SVGFILE

Arguments:
~~~~~~~~~

  -h, --help        show this help message and exit

required arguments:
  -i FASTAFILE      the fasta file
  -o SVGFILE        the svg file

optional arguments:
  -d DOMAIN         the domain file
  -f {pfam,seghca}  the domain file format
