pyHCA and hcatk (HCA toolkit) are a python library and executable for the Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis of protein sequences.
pyHCA implements various class and function for handling sequences and analyses them
hcatk provides off the hands set of program to perform hydrophobic cluster analyses.

Requires
========
- Biopython >= 1.65
- python3   >= 3.4

Installation
============
pip3 install .

Usage
=====

annotate
--------

$ hcatk annotate -h

usage: hcatk annotate [-h] -i INPUTF -o OUTPUTF [-v]
                      [-m {cluster,domain}]
                      [-t {aminoacid,nucleotide}]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUTF             an amino-acid sequence files in fasta format
  -o OUTPUTF            the output file with annotation
  -v                    keep temporary results
  -m {cluster1,cluster2,domain}
                        method to use, cluster: will report *the hydrophobic
                        clusters found in the sequence, domain: will delineate
                        domains based on the hydrophobic cluster profile of
                        the sequence
  -t {aminoacid,nucleotide}
                        the type of the biological sequences passed in the
                        input file

draw
----

$ hcatk draw -h

usage: hcatk draw [-h] -i FASTAFILE [-d DOMAIN] [-f {pfam,seghca}] -o SVGFILE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -i FASTAFILE      the fasta file
  -d DOMAIN         the domain file
  -f {pfam,seghca}  the domain file format
  -o SVGFILE        the svg file
